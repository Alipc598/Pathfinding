# Pathfinding Algorithms Comparison

## Overview
This project provides a detailed comparison between two well-known pathfinding algorithms: A* and Branch and Bound. The comparison is based on various metrics such as nodes explored, execution time, and path efficiency across different scenarios.

## Features
- Implementation of the A* algorithm with heuristic function
- Implementation of the Branch and Bound algorithm
- Comparative analysis based on node exploration and execution time
- Visualizations of the algorithms' paths on grid-based maps

## Interactive Notebooks
The repository contains Jupyter notebooks that can be interactively explored to understand the behavior and performance of the algorithms. The notebooks include:
- `pathfinding_algorithm_comparison.ipynb`: A detailed comparison of the algorithms with visualizations and analysis.

## Usage
To interact with the notebooks, you can use services like [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) to launch a live environment or view them statically via [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).

## Results
The findings indicate that the A* algorithm generally outperforms the Branch and Bound in terms of efficiency and execution time, especially as the complexity of the pathfinding scenario increases.

## Visualization
The visualizations within the notebooks provide an intuitive understanding of the algorithms' search patterns and paths discovered.
